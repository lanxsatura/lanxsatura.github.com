[Lanx Satura](http://lanxsatura.github.io) is a not-for-profit, independent, non-partisan international project for measuring the success and growth of online newsmedia in the genre of Satire. We do not accept any funding for the work we do. We are not paid for, or controlled by, any agency: educational, media, or otherwise. We are not affiliated with any of the companies or organizations that we rank. This project does not relate to academic doctoral (PhD) work we may be doing, nor does it detract from the time dedicated to our higher-priority endeavors, in academia or elsewhere. We take it as our pride that our job is solely to chronicle, rank, and appreciate the online genre of satire news reporting as an artform at the international level.
